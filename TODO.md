# TODO

### Rework APIs
The several APIs we had started seem to be only somewhat functional any more. Turtle comparisons fail, and I couldn't get a single block to be built in column or wall mode. Floor only worked for the block directly beneath the turtle although that could be due to the lack of fuel.

### Re-build the shell
The shell I had built is not in the pastebin repo. Needs to be rebuilt since it's the easiest way to integrate the apis we built with the regular user experience.

### Build the new hotness
A lot of new features have been added to ComputerCraft/Turtles since I last played, and I want to take advantage of these features while building the new OS.
